## Overview

TODO: Write an appropriate overview of your project

## TODO

This project was generated by [wpe-generator]. We try to make sure it generates
a working project for you out of the box, but you NEED to perform the following manual steps before things will work correctly:

- [ ] Configure GitHub repository Settings
  - [ ] Collaborators & teams: add team members
  - [ ] Branches: protect `master` branch
  - [ ] Webhooks: add JIRA and Jenkins webhooks
- [ ] Write an appropriate overview for this project. (The Overview section above.)
- [ ] Create jenkins credentials for your project's staging & production DB passwords,
      someone on [the `Jenkins Role - credentials management` GitHub team][github-team-jenkins-role]
      needs to perform these steps
  - [ ] Create a credential domain in jenkins for your project
  - [ ] Create a "secret text" credential in that domain with id "[project-name]-staging-db-password",
        **ensure that the password doesn't have any symbols** as its embedded in Django's database URL
  - [ ] Create a "secret text" credential in that domain with id "[project-name]-production-db-password",
        **ensure that the password doesn't have any symbols** as its embedded in Django's database URL
  - [ ] Create a "secret text" credential in that domain with id "[project-name]-redis-password"
- [ ] Click `Scan Organization Now` on the [Jenkins WPEngine GitHub Repos page][jenkins-wpe-github] for Jenkins to pull
      in your repository (or wait 24 hours for the nightly build to do so).
      Note that the first deploy in Jenkins will fail its smoke tests as DNS takes longer to propagate than the pipeline
      does to run, rebuilding should get the build passing
- [ ] Verify that the `master` build is green and that the deploy succeeded by visiting the included status endpoint:
      `[project-name].wpesvc.net/v1/status/` and `[project-name]-staging.wpesvc.net/v1/status`

## Follow-up

- [ ] Verify New Relic monitoring, see [docs](docs/monitoring) for details,
      setup uptime alerting by having New Relic monitor your status endpoint (see the `Synthetics` tab)
- [ ] Configure Rollbar reporting, see configuration in `[project-name]/config/settings/base.py`, in addition:
  - [ ] Create a "secret text" credential in the previously created jenkins credential domain with id "[project-name]-rollbar-token"
  - [ ] Uncomment ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN relevant lines in the `Jenkinsfile`
